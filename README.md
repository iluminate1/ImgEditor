# Simple Image Editor
Application realize some images processing algorithms on pure python.

# Algorithms: 
- Convert binary image to grayscale (Two waves method).
 - Convert grayscale image to binary (Avg. brightness and S8 method).
 - Median filtering for grayscale image's.
 - Expansion for binary images.
 - Erosion for binary images
 - Unlocking for binary images
 - Convert rgb image to grayscale.
